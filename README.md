1. The `create_tensor.py` file creates a tensor from raw data (cells’ protein and promoter gene expression rates over time).
2. The `create_json.py` file combines raw and additional data (cells’ surface area, volume, and contacting area with neighbors) and outputs them to JSON files.
3. The `plot_json.py` file visualizes how the five modalities: `surface_area`, `volume`, `contacting_area`, `proteins` and `promoters` vary over time.
