1. The `create_tensor.py` file creates a tensor from raw data: the protein and promoter gene expression rates of cells over time.
2. The `create_json_alive.py` file combines raw and additional data (cells’ age, parent, surface area, volume, and contacting area) and outputs JSON files. This version records data only for cells that are alive.
3. The `create_json_unborn.py` file outputs a comprehensive set of JSON files, including all sample time points—even when a cell is “unborn,” “dead,” or “divided.” Each JSON file also lists the two children into which the cell has divided, if any.
4. The `plot_json.py` file visualizes how the five modalities: `surface_area`, `volume`, `contacting_area`, `proteins` and `promoters` vary over time. For all modalities except `contacting_area`, you can either plot all samples on a single chart or group them. Because `contacting_area` generates too many lines per sample, it must be plotted as a grouped chart.
5. The `build_lineage_tree.py` file builds two lineage tree files `lineage_tree_parent.csv` and `lineage_tree_children.csv`.
